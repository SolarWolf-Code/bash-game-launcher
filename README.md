# bash-game-launcher
A small game launcher that allows for VPN disabling

This tool is mainly for personal use but features the ability to launch any game from the command-line. What is more useful is the ability to prompt the user if they wish to disable their VPN. This comes in handy because some games discourage VPNs


```
git clone https://github.com/SolarWolf-Code/bash-game-launcher && cd bash-game-launcher && echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)" >> ~/.bashrc
```
